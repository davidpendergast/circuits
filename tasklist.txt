bugs:
 - the "action button" and "activate dialog" buttons should be the same (and it should be Enter, not J?)
 - players can splat if they hit the ground with too much speed
	- would be ok, but it's not super consistent
	- only really occurs when you have a lot of downward speed and hit a platform with upward speed
 - teles that start out deactivated shouldn't blip every time the level starts

p3 bugs:
 - falling block is 'squished' in "Heist" preview img?
 - in preview panes, every single block in the level is rendered (but not displayed)
    - leading to fps drops in 'story' levels
 
 
features:
 [/] there should be an indicator when a player desyncs / resyncs
   - implemented, but scrapped
   [ ] maybe bring the desync indicator back at least "?"
 [/] load controls from user-editable file, or otherwise make them editable
 - choose real sounds for things (and make them louder? they don't really cut through the music currently)
   - I think we're mostly... good?
 - level editor
	- ability to choose song in-game
	- import / export / play custom levels

final push:
 [x] finalize song assignments
 - B dialog in intro level
 - A dialog / level in sector_a
   - some brief dialog at beginning of sector A
   - needs new art?
 [x] C dialog / could extend level a bit
 - level / dialog for sector 2
 - D dialog in sector 3
 - flavor text for (all) levels
 - set up itch page
 - acquire usable linux machine and make build

 story:
 - you are: a group of scavenger/scout robots who explore space, searching for materials
   - metals, gadgets, etc.
   - once served an unknown "higher purpose", but that purpose is long forgotten
 - while attempting to approach a massive structure in space, the group's ship crash-lands into it,
   scattering the crew members and damaging the ship.
 - discover the purpose of the megastructure, repair the ship, and escape
 
 resolution:
 - the megastructure is the crew's home/birthplace
 - it was a factory, whose purpose was to build panels that would be used to enwrap the nearby star (dyson sphere)
 - the lifeforms running it (humanlike) gradually went extinct before the project was completed, and the last survivors deactivated it (sending remote workers adrift)
 - does your crew reactivate the factory, and achieve their purpose (to harvest the sun), or drift forever

 ethical dilemma:
 - should we fulfill our own "purpose", at the possible expense of others, or abandon it so others might live
	- doesn't super matter because no one will finish the game
		- but it matters to meeee
		- (the only gamer that matters)
 
 playtesting / feedback:
 
 tester 1 (Te) v0.0.0
 [x] tried to climb right wall with B on level 2
 - hard/confusing to remember which character is which letter (colorblind)
    - fix w/ story?
 [_] tried to fit through gaps in maze
    - it's fine
 [x] too easy to accidentally reset all
 [_] maze was tricky (colorblind?)
    - it's fine
 [_] - trying to squat jump in boulders
    - confusing... but fine?
    - should we bite the bullet and just remove crouching?
    - or redraw it so you don't look smaller?
 [x] lil walkoff on boulders was hard
    - scooched it over
 [x] clipping boulders while jumping over them causes them to fall
 - fast fwd button
    - would be nice, not sure how technically feasible this would be though
    
 tester 2 (Ca): v0.0.1
    - checkin out menu, reading controls
    - instantly solved first level...?
        - levels 1-3 were re-recorded, no biggie
    - game seems to not be running at max FPS MMM
    - lept into spikes on level 5 (stairway), trying to go for A platform as B
        - but learned from that (so probably ok)
        - still would be good to correlated characters to letters better
    - struggled a bit with level 5 (stairway), but re-recorded it with B a few times and got it down
        - struggled to move B onto the switches precisely (may want to fix that)

 tester 3 (Po): v0.0.1
  verbal feedback:
    - would prefer ctrl + r over shift + r
	- ability to click A / B icons on timer bar? (to reset)
	- fast fwd button?
  i noticed:
	game seemed to lag quite a lot (like 60% max fps, yeesh)
		I think they were playing through WINE or something tho
	levels before stairway seemed dull, idk
		- they did stairway pretty quickly though
	maze seemed a bit overwhelming / unfun
		- 1st tried to just hit buttons randomly and force way through
		- i think it taught them the power of visualization tho
		- had a lot of trouble making one of the middle jumps
		- yeah maze did not look very fun haha (12 mins of struggle, in 19 mins of playing)
	boulders was going well but they failed a jump at the very end and died
		- and then they forgot to touch the last rock and lost again in a frustrating way
		- and then again
		- and then had to sit in gay baby jail and wait for B to finish
		- some major oofs on this level
	and then they gave up on the level where you have to desync
		- this is fine; i think the game sorta just wasn't their cup of tea
	
	- all in all, didn't look very fun.
	action items:
		[x] can we make the early levels less painful?
			[x] maybe remove 1-2 pitfalls from boulders?
			[x] make maze easier (less platforming & microspacing)
			[x] make stairway more forgiving (guard-rails around switches)
		[/] fast forward button?
		although tbh I don't really like the gameplay loop this creates.
		I feel like you'd FFW, go too far, reset, repeat a lot
		and you'd be incentivized to FFW at all times (even when moving and such)
		(especially if you were speedrunning, didn't even consider that).
		yeah I think ffw is a no-go.
		
tester 4: (Ax) v0.0.2
	verbal feedback:
		- No complaints from me and I hope this game does well!
		- Is this for a game jam? Seems like a solid game which I feel would win then
		- Really cool concept and I like the usage of time!
	recording:
		didn't record 'landing'
		Arrival - several attempts, they restarted via the pause menu.
			- perfect, overall.
		walljump level, seemed to go well
		'trust' level, also seemed to go pretty well.
		then they stopped.
	thoughts:
		- no actionable items.
			- except maybe that level 3 was too boring and made them stop, idk
			- still wondering if 'Desync' should be level 3
				- idk, i can't ~really~ keep players interested if they don't want to be.
			
tester 5: (No) v0.0.2
	verbal feedback:
		- there were some parts that i couldnt really understand but i caught on later on
			- "mostly at the beginning"
	    - its pretty fun
        - till i got stuck on a level lol
        - only feedback i can give is that maybe with bot a, when youre doing the wall clinging, there should be a button to uncling
		
	i noticed:
		[x] platforming at the start of 'landing' is a little clunky
			- arrival
			- ran to the end of arrival w/out interacting with switch
			- then messed around with switch with B for a bit
			- really struggling with 1st level lol
				- context: I rushed the build and there was a bug that caused instructions to not be shown
			- trying to get A to go to B's exit !!
				- that's not good
				- WHY
				- eventually did it.. it did not work
				- HMM
				- then did it correctly. that is a first
		- game is running well though. lvl 2 
		- got tricked on level (trust), little annoying?
		- lot of unnecessary restarting. perfectionism?
		- did stairway in one try, v nice
		- maze time
			- hitting switches a bit randomly at first (just hoping it'll work out?)
			- seems to have some ideas, no major execution problems like in previous builds
			- failed at the very end with B, then (accidentally?) restarted A
			- maze took 5 mins out of 13 so far. (Arrival took 3.5 mins)
		- boulders
			- lot of trial and error, trying to figure out the correct order
			- eventually got it though. being stuck in gay baby jail looked annoying
			- kinda struggled with wall clinging from the looks of it
			- took like 3 minutes, probably fine
		- desync
			- understood it practically immediately (due to experiences w/ arrival I think)
		- resync
			- understood that practically immediately too. very good
		- crush went well, lots of learning
		- fragility
			- the little walkoff C has to do might be a bit tight
			- accidentally did a full reset?
			[x] not a huge fan of the little jump A has to do on the right side into the narrow gap over the spikes
			- this level has a lot of "gotchas"
				- can't walk on the thing above C's spawn with A
				- can't touch anything or jump with C
				- but got it. was this fun? it didn't look like it
					- is the game supposed to be fun?
						- is life not meant to be pain
				- like 5 mins of playtime
		- beat scaffolding in like a minute, good!
		- catch
			- so this is actually the player's very first time seeing switches get
			  triggered by blocks. so maybe that's not great?
				- edit: actually this sorta happens in boulders with falling blocks, so
			- maybe an early level should introduce this idea first?
			- but he gets it, so maybe it's fine.
			- each part took like 3 attempts to figure out
				- but he got it. 3 mins, good i think
			- tried to jump through double-spikes, probably didn't recognize that they were spikes
				- live and learn 
		- skipped level 5 (which should be ok, i mean otherwise why layout the sector like that)
		- divider
			- so this introduces perma-switches, and it's a desync level.
			- and B is in jail the whole time 
			- this level is actually pretty hard though
			- managed to get C into B's chamber, and hold down the X ?!
				- that's a pretty insane non-solution
				- hard to pull off and won't help HMM
			- then struggle to pull off another non-solution for a while
			- and then quit, when he couldn't pull it off
			- 10 mins on this level. 
				- gave it quite a solid try though, but that effort was not rewarded
		40 mins total.
	thoughts:
		[ ] player-letter correlation is a big problem
			- dialog should help. will players remember though?
			- anything else?
		[ ] action key is confusing? since it basically does nothing for most of the game
		- managed to proactively desync A on Arrival
			- which is encouraging if I want to move 'Desync' up
		[x] Divider is quite difficult for that position in the levels
			- it's literally the 3rd / 4th desync level in the game
			- and requires two(?) non-obvious alignments
			- and has some brutal false solutions
			- it's skippable, but... it feels super bad to skip levels in puzzle games
		[ ] I think they didn't notice sector A, which could be an issue.
			- idk! those levels aren't super great anyways.
		[x] unrelated to playthrough but 'help' should tell you that B can jump out of C's arms
		[/] how does the player feel when they start a sector and see like 9 uncleared levels ahead of them?
			- does this feel bad? should they be hidden until you unlock them?
			- info overload?
			- or does it not really matter
			- like if they're hidden, the player still *knows* that there will be like 10 levels in the zone
				- and ideally they'd want to experience more levels? lol
				- idk. i don't think it matters
		
list of dropoff points:
	- MAZE     (1-6) 	(after completion)
	- DESYNC   (1-8) 	(before completion)
	- DIVIDER  (2-6)    (before) <-- problem
    - SISYPHUS (2-9)    (haven't tested again since fixing, but requires a 'discovery')
    - PIT OF DESPAIR	(probably? coin toss)
	- SPLIT is probably kinda hard?
	- RELEASE
	- PATHWAYS
	- ... at this point most levels are getting pretty brutal, so idk
	- ultimately, it's a difficult game. people aren't going to beat it in a single playthrough
	  and that's probably ok. That's the nature of hard puzzle games 
	
 level ideas:
 - single room with many moving platforms
    - like https://youtu.be/eYJAnXgI0AU?t=1577
 - complex desyncs involving blocking / unblocking teleporters
 - complex desyncing involving teleporting/carrying players
    - B goes, does some stuff
    - C goes, picks up B, doesn't teleport
    - A goes, allows C to teleport with B

puzzle archetypes:
    - resource exchanges (delivering something to a future ghost, or altering the environment to help a future ghost)
    - path alteration (changing the behavior of a past ghost by altering the environment)
        - ghost objectification (picking up another ghost, using to acomplish something else entirely)
        - ghost nullification (stopping another ghost from doing something)
    - option-selects (using a route that will have different outcomes depending on the actions of a future ghost)
    - traditional platforming challenges (running, jumping, climbing trees)
    - resource allocation (should I use this now, or leave it for a future ghost)
        - should i prevent a past ghost from using a resource
    - coordination (need to act in-sync with a past ghost)
    - ghost avoidance (staying out of the way of a past ghost, so as to not knock them off their path)
    	- and the flip-side, avoiding taking a path that will force a future ghost to interrupt it

ideas for mechanics:
    - a robot that leaves a trail of spikes or corrupts blocks in some way (making it so other robots can't touch them)
    ? picking up other robots, throwing them
    - freezing other robots
    - swapping positions with other robots
    - teleporters with a limited number of uses
    - a boulder-type block that C can push
    - lasers that kill player, but can be blocked

Level editor:    
    [ ] (P1) increase / decrease duration for specs
    
General:
    [ ] failing levels
	- just keep it running but say R to restart or something?
	- pause timer
    [ ] scene transitions of some kind
        - "player A go!"
	- "level complete!"
	- "you died!"
	- like nuclear throne, still image, text_bg, and text move slowly with parallax
Art:
    - more blocks
    - or use that big brain of yours to generate blocks

Performance:
    - breakable blocks cause lag spikes


Old Thoughts (1/3/21):
   the good:
   - the physics engine works quite well
   - the level editor is pretty slick
   - the 3D stuff is a nice addition to the engine, but its questionably appropriate in this game
   the bad:
   - the async gameplay does not feel very good
   - it's hard to design good puzzles for it
   - it's really clunky trying to coordinate the actors
   - the visuals are pretty ugly (colors especially)
   - single-screen puzzles feel quite cramped
 
How to proceed:
  - ditch the syncronous gameplay, instead let you switch between characters mid-level? (like yoshi's island 2)
  - redo the environment graphics?

New thoughts 1/11/21:
  - graphics and gameplay actually seems better now (lighting helped a lot).
  - and puzzles are coming together easier.
  - full speed ahead with original plan
