bugs:
 - the "action button" and "activate dialog" buttons should be the same (and it should be Enter, not J?)
 - players can splat if they hit the ground with too much speed
	- would be ok, but it's not super consistent

p3 bugs:
 - falling block is 'squished' in "Heist" preview img
 - falling blocks are inconsistently destroyed when a door block is activated on top of them
 - sector text gets misaligned at certain window heights
 
 
features:
 - hook up stats + credits scene to final level
    [x] what final level?
 [x] let you embed stuff (e.g. "{ACTION_KEY}" --> [Enter]) into dialog / info text.
    - with a special color
	  - relax
 [x] there should be an indicator when a player desyncs / resyncs
 - load controls from user-editable file, or otherwise make them editable
 - choose real sounds for things (and make them louder? they don't really cut through the music currently)
 [x] stats scene (total playtime, total best level time sum, levels completed)
 [x] teleporters getting blocked

 story:
 - you are: a group of scavenger/scout robots who explore space, searching for materials
   - metals, gadgets, etc.
   - once served an unknown "higher purpose", but that purpose is long forgotten
 - while attempting to approach a massive structure in space, the group's ship crash-lands into it,
   scattering the crew members and damaging the ship.
 - discover the purpose of the megastructure, repair the ship, and escape
 
 resolution:
 - the megastructure is the crew's home/birthplace
 - it was a factory, whose purpose was to build panels that would be used to enwrap the nearby star (dyson sphere)
 - the lifeforms running it (humanlike) gradually went extinct before the project was completed, and the last survivors deactivated it (sending remote workers adrift)
 - does your crew reactivate the factory, and achieve their purpose (to harvest the sun), or drift forever

 ethical dilemma:
 - should we fulfill our own "purpose", at the possible expense of others, or abandon it so others might live
 
 playtesting / feedback:
 
 tester 1 (Te)
 [x] tried to climb right wall with B on level 2
 - hard/confusing to remember which character is which letter (colorblind)
    - fix w/ story?
 [_] tried to fit through gaps in maze
    - it's fine
 [x] too easy to accidentally reset all
 [_] maze was tricky (colorblind?)
    - it's fine
 [_] - trying to squat jump in boulders
    - confusing... but fine?
    - should we bite the bullet and just remove crouching?
    - or redraw it so you don't look smaller?
 [x] lil walkoff on boulders was hard
    - scooched it over
 [x] clipping boulders while jumping over them causes them to fall
 - fast fwd button
    - would be nice, not sure how technically feasible this would be though
    
 tester 2 (Ca):
    - checkin out menu, reading controls
    - instantly solved first level...?
        - levels 1-3 were re-recorded, no biggie
    - game seems to not be running at max FPS MMM
    - lept into spikes on level 5 (stairway), trying to go for A platform as B
        - but learned from that (so probably ok)
        - still would be good to correlated characters to letters better
    - struggled a bit with level 5 (stairway), but re-recorded it with B a few times and got it down
        - struggled to move B onto the switches precisely (may want to fix that)

 tester 3 (Po):
  verbal feedback:
    - would prefer ctrl + r over shift + r
	- ability to click A / B icons on timer bar? (to reset)
	- fast fwd button?
  i noticed:
	game seemed to lag quite a lot (like 60% max fps, yeesh)
		I think they were playing through WINE or something tho
	levels before stairway seemed dull, idk
		- they did stairway pretty quickly though
	maze seemed a bit overwhelming / unfun
		- 1st tried to just hit buttons randomly and force way through
		- i think it taught them the power of visualization tho
		- had a lot of trouble making one of the middle jumps
		- yeah maze did not look very fun haha (12 mins of struggle, in 19 mins of playing)
	boulders was going well but they failed a jump at the very end and died
		- and then they forgot to touch the last rock and lost again in a frustrating way
		- and then again
		- and then had to sit in gay baby jail and wait for B to finish
		- some major oofs on this level
	and then they gave up on the level where you have to desync
		- this is fine; i think the game sorta just wasn't their cup of tea
	
	- all in all, didn't look very fun.
	action items:
		[x] can we make the early levels less painful?
			[x] maybe remove 1-2 pitfalls from boulders?
			[x] make maze easier (less platforming & microspacing)
			[x] make stairway more forgiving (guard-rails around switches)
		[/] fast forward button?
		although tbh I don't really like the gameplay loop this creates.
		I feel like you'd FFW, go too far, reset, repeat a lot
		and you'd be incentivized to FFW at all times (even when moving and such)
		(especially if you were speedrunning, didn't even consider that).
		yeah I think ffw is a no-go.
		
tester 4: (Ax)
	verbal feedback:
		- No complaints from me and I hope this game does well!
		- Is this for a game jam? Seems like a solid game which I feel would win then
		- Really cool concept and I like the usage of time!
	recording:
		didn't record 'landing'
		Arrival - several attempts, they restarted via the pause menu.
			- perfect, overall.
		walljump level, seemed to go well
		'trust' level, also seemed to go pretty well.
		then they stopped.
	thoughts:
		- no actionable items.
			- except maybe that level 3 was too boring and made them stop, idk
			- still wondering if 'Desync' should be level 3
				- idk, i can't ~really~ keep players interested if they don't want to be.
			
tester 5: (No)
	verbal feedback:
		- there were some parts that i couldnt really understand but i caught on later on
			- ("mostly at the beginning")
	    - its pretty fun
        - till i got stuck on a level lol
        - only feedback i can give is that maybe with bot a, when youre doing the wall clinging, there should be a button to uncling
	
    
    
 level ideas:
 - single room with many moving platforms
    - like https://youtu.be/eYJAnXgI0AU?t=1577
 - complex desyncs involving blocking / unblocking teleporters
 - complex desyncing involving teleporting/carrying players
    - B goes, does some stuff
    - C goes, picks up B, doesn't teleport
    - A goes, allows C to teleport with B

puzzle archetypes:
    - resource exchanges (delivering something to a future ghost, or altering the environment to help a future ghost)
    - path alteration (changing the behavior of a past ghost by altering the environment)
        - ghost objectification (picking up another ghost, using to acomplish something else entirely)
        - ghost nullification (stopping another ghost from doing something)
    - option-selects (using a route that will have different outcomes depending on the actions of a future ghost)
    - traditional platforming challenges (running, jumping, climbing trees)
    - resource allocation (should I use this now, or leave it for a future ghost)
        - should i prevent a past ghost from using a resource
    - coordination (need to act in-sync with a past ghost)
    - ghost avoidance (staying out of the way of a past ghost, so as to not knock them off their path)
    	- and the flip-side, avoiding taking a path that will force a future ghost to interrupt it

ideas for mechanics:
    - a robot that leaves a trail of spikes or corrupts blocks in some way (making it so other robots can't touch them)
    ? picking up other robots, throwing them
    - freezing other robots
    - swapping positions with other robots
    - teleporters with a limited number of uses
    - a boulder-type block that C can push
    - lasers that kill player, but can be blocked

Level editor:    
    [ ] (P1) increase / decrease duration for specs
    
General:
    [ ] failing levels
	- just keep it running but say R to restart or something?
	- pause timer
    [ ] scene transitions of some kind
        - "player A go!"
	- "level complete!"
	- "you died!"
	- like nuclear throne, still image, text_bg, and text move slowly with parallax
Art:
    - more blocks
    - or use that big brain of yours to generate blocks

Performance:
    - breakable blocks cause lag spikes


Old Thoughts (1/3/21):
   the good:
   - the physics engine works quite well
   - the level editor is pretty slick
   - the 3D stuff is a nice addition to the engine, but its questionably appropriate in this game
   the bad:
   - the async gameplay does not feel very good
   - it's hard to design good puzzles for it
   - it's really clunky trying to coordinate the actors
   - the visuals are pretty ugly (colors especially)
   - single-screen puzzles feel quite cramped
 
How to proceed:
  - ditch the syncronous gameplay, instead let you switch between characters mid-level? (like yoshi's island 2)
  - redo the environment graphics?

New thoughts 1/11/21:
  - graphics and gameplay actually seems better now (lighting helped a lot).
  - and puzzles are coming together easier.
  - full speed ahead with original plan
