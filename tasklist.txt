bugs:
 - triangle colliders are a pixel "wider" than rectangles I believe
 - camera lags behind player a frame (I think)
 - animations can "flicker" in certain situations
 
features:
 - saving / loading levels
 - edit levels
 - bonus jump if you walk off -> jump quickly?
 - make physics deterministic (or abandon replay idea?)
    - lets at least give it a shot
 - other characters
