bugs:
 - triangle colliders are a pixel "wider" than rectangles I believe
 - should snap to vertical slopes too
 - glitchy animation when you run into a wall to the right
 
features:
 - saving / loading levels
 - edit levels
 - make physics deterministic (or abandon replay idea?)
    - (abandon replay idea? - cmon)
    - lets at least give it a shot
 - joypad support
 - main menu?
    
issues:
 - the pastel colors don't really fit with the monochrome ship asthetics
    - could be OK? if the inside of the ship is more colorful
 - maybe ditch (or modify) the monocrome ship image
    
    
vertical slice: 
 [x] title screen 
    [x] logo, still image, options for [start, continue, controls, editor]
 [x] overworld
    [x] can select levels in a grid connected by paths, with branches and stuff
    [x] some kind of spaceship graphics (or rocks)
        - design basically ripped from baba (where all my good ideas come from)
        - should be extremely modular
 - in levels 
    [x] platforming phyiscs
    [x] play alongside your "ghosts"
    - mixture of longer, traditional single-robot platforming challenges
        and multi-robot coordination puzzles
 - level editor
    - save / load levels as json
    - create / move / modify objects in the game
    - toggle between play mode and edit mode
    - some kind of in-editor console where you can modify stuff more directly
    ui:
      - creation sidepanel
        - select objects to create from grid
      - metadata sidepanel
        - edit level name, etc. (json text editor)
      - modification sidepanel
        - edit json attributes selected object (in world)
 - credits
    (to make it a complete game~)
 

puzzle archetypes:
    - resource exchanges (delivering something to a future ghost)
    - path alteration (changing the behavior of a past ghost by altering the environment)
        - ghost objectification (picking up another ghost, using to acomplish something else entirely)
        - ghost nullification (stopping another ghost from doing something)
    - option-selects (using route that will have different outcomes depending on the actions of a future ghost)
    - traditional platforming challenges (running, jumping, climbing trees)
    - resource allocation (should I use this now, or leave it for a future ghost)
        - should i prevent a past ghost from using a resource
    - coordination (need to act in-sync with a past ghost)
    
Level editor:    
    [ ] (P1) add / remove points to moving blocks
    [ ] (P1) increase / decrease duration for specs
    [x] (P1) let you choose which level to edit
    [ ] (P3) let you edit metadata of levels / specs
    
General:
    [x] UI for editing text
    [x] (P1) moving camera in levels (horizontal only?)
        - should encompass the active player + ghosts if possible 
    [x] locks and doors
    [ ] completing levels
    [ ] animation when you reach the finish
    [ ] animation when you spawn
    [ ] kill blocks
    [ ] scene transitions of some kind
        - "player A go!"
	- "level complete!"
	- "you died!"
	- like nuclear throne, still image, text_bg, and text move slowly with parallax
