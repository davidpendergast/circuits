bugs:
 - progress isn't saved when game exits via crash
 - question mark info entities (e.g. tips) shouldn't have dialog
 - the "action button" and "activate dialog" buttons should be the same (and it should be Enter, not J?)
 - falling block is 'squished' in "Heist" preview img
 - falling blocks are inconsistently destroyed when a door block is activated on top of them
 
 
features:
 - hook up stats + credits scene to final level
    [x] what final level?
 [x] let you embed stuff (e.g. "{ACTION_KEY}" --> [Enter]) into dialog / info text.
    - with a special color
 - there should be an indicator when a player desyncs / resyncs
 - load controls from user-editable file, or otherwise make them editable
 - choose real sounds for things (and make them louder? they don't really cut through the music currently)
 - stats scene (total playtime, total best level time sum, levels completed)
 - sector names + completion status
 
 
 release checklist:
 [x] make_exe for Windows
 [ ] make_exe for Linux
 [ ] make_exe for MacOS
 [ ] display version number in game
 
 
 
features:
 - joypad support
    
 - pop-out editor
    - esc to cancel pop-out editor
    - make sure pop-out editor isn't adding extra newlines?
    - make sure tkinter is properly marked as a requirement for the project / handle missing case better
    - make pop-out editor highlight everything by default
    - make a more convenient synchronous text editor method
    - make a more convenient json editor method
    - make pop-out editor stretchy and make it remember its bounds
    
 - dialog
    - make text appear letter-by-letter
    
 - sound
    - start adding sound effects
        - find good sound pack
    
 - mechanics
    A: done?
    B: done?
    C: done?
    D: done?
    
 - secret areas
    [X] invisiblocks
    [X] camera pans to area only if it's visible?
    - things to talk to
    
    
vertical slice: 
 [x] title screen 
    [x] logo, still image, options for [start, continue, controls, editor]
 [x] overworld
    [x] can select levels in a grid connected by paths, with branches and stuff
    [x] some kind of spaceship graphics (or rocks)
        [x] design basically ripped from baba (where all my good ideas come from)
        [x] should be extremely modular
    [x] levels should be locked until adjacent levels are beaten
    [x] it should clearly show when levels are beaten
    [x] some kind of generated graphic for each level
 [x] in levels 
    [x] platforming phyiscs
    [x] play alongside your "ghosts"
    [x] something interesting for C to do (breaking floors)
 [x] level editor
    [x] save / load levels as json
    [x] create / move / modify objects in the game
    [x] toggle between play mode and edit mode
    [x] some kind of in-editor console where you can modify stuff more directly
 [x] progress should save
 - music (royalty-free 'placeholder' is fine)
 - sound effects
 - content
    [x] finish AB levels and overworld
    - finish C levels and overworld
    - finish D levels and overworld
    - descriptions for each level (a story of some kind?)
 - credits
    (to make it a complete game~)
 

puzzle archetypes:
    - resource exchanges (delivering something to a future ghost, or altering the environment to help a future ghost)
    - path alteration (changing the behavior of a past ghost by altering the environment)
        - ghost objectification (picking up another ghost, using to acomplish something else entirely)
        - ghost nullification (stopping another ghost from doing something)
    - option-selects (using a route that will have different outcomes depending on the actions of a future ghost)
    - traditional platforming challenges (running, jumping, climbing trees)
    - resource allocation (should I use this now, or leave it for a future ghost)
        - should i prevent a past ghost from using a resource
    - coordination (need to act in-sync with a past ghost)
    - ghost avoidance (staying out of the way of a past ghost, so as to not knock them off their path)
    	- and the flip-side, avoiding taking a path that will force a future ghost to interrupt it

ideas for mechanics:
    - a robot that leaves a trail of spikes or corrupts blocks in some way (making it so other robots can't touch them)
    ? picking up other robots, throwing them
    - freezing other robots
    - swapping positions with other robots
    - teleporters with a limited number of uses
    - a boulder-type block that C can push
    - lasers that kill player, but can be blocked

    - preventing a block from falling
        - by standing on it
        - by putting something under it
    - causing block to break
        - by jumping through it (C only)
        - by causing a falling block to fall through it
    - preventing a block from breaking
        - by blocking whatever breaks it
    - picking up another player (C only)
    - preventing another player from being picked up
    - Preventing player from using teleporter (by using it first)

Level editor:    
    [ ] (P1) increase / decrease duration for specs
    
General:
    [ ] failing levels
	- just keep it running but say R to restart or something?
	- pause timer
    [ ] scene transitions of some kind
        - "player A go!"
	- "level complete!"
	- "you died!"
	- like nuclear throne, still image, text_bg, and text move slowly with parallax
Art:
    - more blocks
    - or use that big brain of yours to generate blocks

Performance:
    - breakable blocks cause lag spikes


Old Thoughts (1/3/21):
   the good:
   - the physics engine works quite well
   - the level editor is pretty slick
   - the 3D stuff is a nice addition to the engine, but its questionably appropriate in this game
   the bad:
   - the async gameplay does not feel very good
   - it's hard to design good puzzles for it
   - it's really clunky trying to coordinate the actors
   - the visuals are pretty ugly (colors especially)
   - single-screen puzzles feel quite cramped
 
How to proceed:
  - ditch the syncronous gameplay, instead let you switch between characters mid-level? (like yoshi's island 2)
  - redo the environment graphics?

New thoughts 1/11/21:
  - graphics and gameplay actually seems better now (lighting helped a lot).
  - and puzzles are coming together easier.
  - full speed ahead with original plan
