bugs:
 - progress isn't saved when game exits via crash
 - the "action button" and "activate dialog" buttons should be the same (and it should be Enter, not J?)
 - players can splat if they hit the ground with too much speed

p3 bugs:
 - falling block is 'squished' in "Heist" preview img
 - falling blocks are inconsistently destroyed when a door block is activated on top of them
 
 
features:
 - hook up stats + credits scene to final level
    [x] what final level?
 [x] let you embed stuff (e.g. "{ACTION_KEY}" --> [Enter]) into dialog / info text.
    - with a special color
 - there should be an indicator when a player desyncs / resyncs
 - load controls from user-editable file, or otherwise make them editable
 - choose real sounds for things (and make them louder? they don't really cut through the music currently)
 - stats scene (total playtime, total best level time sum, levels completed)
 [x] teleporters getting blocked
 - teleporting while holding something

 story:
 - you are: a group of scavenger/scout robots who explore space, searching for materials
   - metals, gadgets, etc.
   - once served an unknown "higher purpose", but that purpose is long forgotten
 - while attempting to approach a massive structure in space, the group's ship crash-lands into it,
   scattering the crew members and damaging the ship.
 - discover the purpose of the megastructure, repair the ship, and escape
 
 resolution:
 - the megastructure is the crew's home/birthplace
 - it was a factory, whose purpose was to build panels that would be used to enwrap the nearby star (dyson sphere)
 - the lifeforms running it (humanlike) gradually went extinct before the project was completed, and the last survivors deactivated it (sending remote workers adrift)
 - does your crew reactivate the factory, and achieve their purpose (to harvest the sun), or drift forever

 ethical dilemma:
 - should we fulfill our own "purpose", at the possible expense of others, or abandon it so others might live
 
 feedback:
 [x] tried to climb right wall with B on level 2
 - hard/confusing to remember which character is which letter (colorblind)
    - fix w/ story?
 [_] tried to fit through gaps in maze
    - it's fine
 [x] too easy to accidentally reset all
 [_] maze was tricky (colorblind?)
    - it's fine
 [_] - trying to squat jump in boulders
    - confusing... but fine?
    - should we bite the bullet and just remove crouching?
    - or redraw it so you don't look smaller?
 [x] lil walkoff on boulders was hard
    - scooched it over
 [x] clipping boulders while jumping over them causes them to fall
 - fast fwd button
    - would be nice, not sure how technically feasible this would be though
    
    
 level ideas:
 - single room with many moving platforms
    - like https://youtu.be/eYJAnXgI0AU?t=1577
 - complex desyncs involving blocking / unblocking teleporters
 - complex desyncing involving teleporting/carrying players
    - B goes, does some stuff
    - C goes, picks up B, doesn't teleport
    - A goes, allows C to teleport with B

    (to make it a complete game~)
 

puzzle archetypes:
    - resource exchanges (delivering something to a future ghost, or altering the environment to help a future ghost)
    - path alteration (changing the behavior of a past ghost by altering the environment)
        - ghost objectification (picking up another ghost, using to acomplish something else entirely)
        - ghost nullification (stopping another ghost from doing something)
    - option-selects (using a route that will have different outcomes depending on the actions of a future ghost)
    - traditional platforming challenges (running, jumping, climbing trees)
    - resource allocation (should I use this now, or leave it for a future ghost)
        - should i prevent a past ghost from using a resource
    - coordination (need to act in-sync with a past ghost)
    - ghost avoidance (staying out of the way of a past ghost, so as to not knock them off their path)
    	- and the flip-side, avoiding taking a path that will force a future ghost to interrupt it

ideas for mechanics:
    - a robot that leaves a trail of spikes or corrupts blocks in some way (making it so other robots can't touch them)
    ? picking up other robots, throwing them
    - freezing other robots
    - swapping positions with other robots
    - teleporters with a limited number of uses
    - a boulder-type block that C can push
    - lasers that kill player, but can be blocked

Level editor:    
    [ ] (P1) increase / decrease duration for specs
    
General:
    [ ] failing levels
	- just keep it running but say R to restart or something?
	- pause timer
    [ ] scene transitions of some kind
        - "player A go!"
	- "level complete!"
	- "you died!"
	- like nuclear throne, still image, text_bg, and text move slowly with parallax
Art:
    - more blocks
    - or use that big brain of yours to generate blocks

Performance:
    - breakable blocks cause lag spikes


Old Thoughts (1/3/21):
   the good:
   - the physics engine works quite well
   - the level editor is pretty slick
   - the 3D stuff is a nice addition to the engine, but its questionably appropriate in this game
   the bad:
   - the async gameplay does not feel very good
   - it's hard to design good puzzles for it
   - it's really clunky trying to coordinate the actors
   - the visuals are pretty ugly (colors especially)
   - single-screen puzzles feel quite cramped
 
How to proceed:
  - ditch the syncronous gameplay, instead let you switch between characters mid-level? (like yoshi's island 2)
  - redo the environment graphics?

New thoughts 1/11/21:
  - graphics and gameplay actually seems better now (lighting helped a lot).
  - and puzzles are coming together easier.
  - full speed ahead with original plan
