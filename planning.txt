a puzzle platformer where you record and replay your actions to clear levels.

characters:
    robots, with different sizes, attributes and actions.
    
    "A" - M - can Move, Jump, Walljump
    "B" - S - can Move, Attack?
    "C" - L - can Move, Jump, Grab & Drop Things, Throw Things
    "D" - M - can Fly, Grab & Drop Things

levels:
 - predetermined set of characters per level (allowing duplicates?)
 - assigned start & end locations for each character.
 - order of use is pre-determined
    - start controlling the next character when the previous one's circuit is completed
    - if you "break" the circuit of a previous character, it will prevent you 
      from completing the current one
 - time limit per circuit (60 seconds generally?)
 - ideally a single screen
    
 - goal: bring all characters from their start position to their end position.
 
controls:
 - WASD / arrow keys to move, jump, navigate menus
 - space to jump
 - JKL or ZXC to do special ability, pickup / drop items, etc. ?
 - Esc to pause 
 - R to restart current character, Shift-R to restart full level?
    - esc -> restart
    - esc -> pick character to restart from
 - NO MOUSE, except optionally on menus
 - gamepad support pls

platformer mechanics:
 ** this will require a lot of thought **
 - moving platforms
 - slopes
 - platforms that can be controlled
    - like with buttons, in monkey ball?
 
 - switches...
    - so boring, are these necessary?
    - i actually hate switches so much
    - let's see if we can avoid having them
    
 - no switches, no buttons, how does the player influence the level?
    - must be position or impact-based
        - this problem has been solved actually:
            - mario-style action blocks you bonk on to activate?
            - mario-style "p-switches"
 
core features:
 - easily edit / share levels (through cut and paste, like linerider)
    - (well, through json at least...)
 - branching overworld map (like baba)
 - save & reload replays (replay will auto play at end of each level, like meatboy)
