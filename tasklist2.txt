It's time to reset. Make the game easier to work on.

core gameplay
- remove player D swapping, unnecessary with teleportation
- grabbing
    - player C draw arms properly
    DONE animation / sound for whiffing a grab
    - dropped items should keep momentum + maybe some boost
    - animate player B bouncing properly while held
- make crouching change player's height?


mechanics
- rework falling block to be simpler
    DONE starts falling when stood on (threshold depends on weight of player)
    DONE never moves horizontally
    DONE ignores moving blocks
    DONE? visual effects / art to show block state

- portals
    NOPE "Portal"-style, in the sense that it preserves speed + direction
    DONE should be very much 2D, built into crevaces only
    ??? non-directional
    
    
music + sound
 - Split songs in 3-4 'layers' (e.g. instruments) each of which coorrespond to a character.
   when a character is active (and not dead), the music will include that layer
   (when all characters are dead, the music fades out)
 - Can we smoothly fade into different versions of songs?
    
    
(optional)
- false blocks
    - blocks that don't have collision areas and fade when you step onto them
    - (for secrets)
    

- finish the dang buttons in the level editor

bugs
- you can put two identical blocks on top of each other in the editor, leading to all kinds of issues
    
- actors that can't be controlled but have behavior that integrates with other systems    
    - slug? or NPC?
    - spiky NPC?
    
- use that big brain of yours to build some damn levels

- music (placeholder is fine)
- classic sounds
- cutscenes / dialog
- credits~

Then... game is done?
