It's time to reset. Make the game easier to work on.

core gameplay
- player D behavior = J to swap with nearest other character
- player C draw arms properly
    - animation / sound for whiffing a grab
- animate player B bouncing while held
- player A and B "J" acitons
- remove crouching (except for player B, bc it's cute)

mechanics
- rework falling block to be simpler
    - starts falling when stood on 
    - never moves horizontally

- portals
    - "Portal"-style, in the sense that it preserves speed + direction
    - should be very much 2D, built into crevaces only
    - non-directional
    
- false blocks
    - blocks that don't have collision areas and fade when you step onto them
    
- slug? or NPC?
- spiky NPC?
    
- use that big brain of yours to build some damn levels

- music (placeholder is fine)
- classic sounds
- cutscenes / dialog

Then... game is done?
