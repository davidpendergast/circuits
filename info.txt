Advanced Controls
-----------------

Toggle FPS Display:              F3  (appears in window's title bar)
Toggle Compatibiliy Mode*:       F6  (see description below)

*Compatibility mode will cause the game to be rendered without the GPU or OpenGL.
The performance will be worse but it should allow the game to work on systems it
otherwise wouldn't. The game will automatically switch to this mode on startup if
it fails to create an OpenGL context (if this occurs, the main menu will have a 
solid black background instead of the 3D ship and say "compatibility mode").
