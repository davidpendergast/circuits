"Hey There! Dear People! :)

Thanks for asking about License info! Main "Rules" are the following:
You can find the short answer at the end ...

What is allowed?

- you can use any assets in your games / projects / webpage ... of course!
Good Luck with that! Make a great game!

- you can modify them if you want to
If you rather prefer your own versions of my assets, do it. Just do it!

- you can share my work & your work & the asset packages
Please don't forget to mention you found it on: gamesupply.itch.io
Thanks! That's how more people can get this content on the original page.

- and Yes! Commercial use is permitted! Make a good art!
You can sell your hard work made from these asset packages!
I've never seen my game assets in TV before. Now I want :)

What is NOT allowed?

- you can not resell game asset packages on anywhere(originally these are for sale, note that it's a special period now)
That's not a good way to buy / get and resell this content somewhere else.
Believe me: you can make your own work and that's more fun to do! :)

Optional

- if you credit me I really appreciate that! Thank you for not forgetting me.
It's Optional, not necesarry... ( please refer as: gamesupply.itch.io )

Short answer

USE: OK! (any project)
EDIT: OK! (you can modify)
SHARE: OK! (please include itchio link)
CREDIT: OPTIONAL! (& really appreciated!)
DONATIONS: OPTIONAL! (& really appreciated!)
COMMERCIAL: OK! (you can sell your hard work)

RESELL: NOT OK! (you can't resell the original content)

So I think - based on the mentioned terms - the nearest solution to your question is https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ from the CC License Collection.
