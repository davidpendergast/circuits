vents: Tight spaces and dark places.
stairway: This one requires some coordination.
trust: The path splits for Unit {PLAYER_A}, or does it?
maze: A large chasm blocks Unit {PLAYER_B}'s path. Thankfully there are some blocks to stand on.
boulders: These blocks have strange gravitational properties - watch your step!
resync: Sometimes getting back on track is the hard part.
meeting: Ensuring the safety of the other crewmembers is one of Unit {PLAYER_A}'s primary functions, and hasn't left their CPU since the crash. Perhaps some clues to their whereabouts lie ahead.

crush: Your new companion is a little heavier than Units {PLAYER_A} and {PLAYER_B}.
scaffolding: You start getting the sense that {PLAYER_C} exceeds the weight limit of this area.
catch: Just Unit {PLAYER_C}'s luck - more flimsy platforms.
chimney: Down the shoot(?)
blockage: Similiar to 'Arrival', but not quite the same.
