Status (5/9/21):

Development has completely stalled.
Stuck on solving collision issues with movable blocks.
Unable to compose music for the game, lose interest in songs after making 1 bar.
Failing to find a place for the story/atmospheric elements I want to include.
The time-based puzzle system makes it hard to include things like dialog, exploration.
Hard to come up with fresh ideas for puzzles. 
Overwhelmed thinking about the number of puzzles the game should have.

Real causes:

Mental health is at an all time low. 
Physical health & hygiene is at an all time low.
I'm losing interest and stagnating in every aspect of life, not just this game.
Important: Working on this game / finishing this game will not fix these issues.
"There's no rush"-syndrome
